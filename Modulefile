summary 'Create arbitrary Puppet Facts from Hiera or Puppet Classes'
description 'This module allows you to create arbitrary Puppet Facts using Puppet code or your Hiera backend. This can be useful to document your machines or even your Puppet classes. A class could for example create it's own Fact, which when queried by a different class, could determine if the class has been applied to the machine or any other state that might be interesting to report.'
